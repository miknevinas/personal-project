# Manuel's Restaurant
##### A MEAN-Stack app for a real restaurant

## Synopsis

This is a website built to demonstrate working knowledge of the MEAN stack. The project was inspired by my uncle's restaurant based in Austin. I noticed that his website was functional enough, but lacked modern styling and mobile optimization, so I added both, along with a MEAN stack online ordering utility.

## Usage

This app is solely for demonstration of skills.  The live version can be found [here] (https://manuels.herokuapp.com/#/).

## Built With

* MEAN
* MaterializeCSS
