# Manuel's Restaurant
### A MEAN-Stack app for a real restaurant

## Synopsis

This is a website built with the MEAN stack to demonstrate said skills. The website is based off my uncle's restaurant based in Austin. I noticed that his website was functional enough, but lacked modern styling and mobile optimization, so I added both, along with an online ordering utility to demonstrate knowledge of the MEAN stack. The live version can be found [here] (https://manuels.herokuapp.com/#/).

## Usage

This app is solely for demonstration of knowledge.

## Built With

* MEAN
* MaterializeCSS
